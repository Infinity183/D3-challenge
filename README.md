# D3-challenge
For this assignment, I built a scatter plot using D3 functions in a JavaScript app. Given a CSV data set with information about poverty and smoking rates in each American state, I read the values using D3.csv and then appended an SVG chart with scatter points whose coordinates are based on these values. All the while, I formatted the chart to be easy and intuitive to read.

This particular chart graphs the relationship poverty rate and smoking rate. Poverty rate values are gauged as the coordinates, while smoking rate values are gauged as the y coordinates.

I added state abbreviations (lifted from the CSV file) as labels to each chart point and defined the x and y axes' domains to be dependent on the minimum and maximum values of poverty and smoking rates, respectively.
